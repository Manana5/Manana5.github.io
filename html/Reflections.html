            </p><br/>
            <p>2. Set weekly targets that will help towards reaching milestones.
            </p><br/>
            <p>3. Set daily targets that encompass the nitty-gritties of designing the website. Be sure to make allowance for unexpected disturbances, e.g. unknown family trips, overtime at work, house chores, lack of data/Wi-Fi, etc.
            </p><br/>
        <p>4. To try not break streaks of productivity and because time may not avail itself every day due to work and home chores, binge on work at specific times. For example, weekends & public holidays.
